Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) — attacker injects JavaScript into pages viewed by other users.
Mitigation: output‑encode/escape, use CSP, sanitize inputs.

Cross‑Site Request Forgery (CSRF) — attacker causes a logged‑in user’s browser to perform unwanted actions.
Mitigation: use anti‑CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, require re‑auth for critical ops.

Broken Authentication / Session Hijacking — stealing or guessing credentials or session tokens.
Mitigation: strong password policies, MFA, secure cookie flags, short sessions.

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR / Broken Access Control) — users access resources they shouldn’t by manipulating IDs/paths.
Mitigation: enforce server‑side authorization checks, use unguessable IDs.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) — attacker causes the server to execute arbitrary code.
Mitigation: avoid unsafe eval/exec, use least privilege, patch dependencies.

Command Injection — unsanitized input is passed to system shell commands.
Mitigation: avoid shelling out with user input; use safe APIs or strong validation/escaping.

Server‑Side Request Forgery (SSRF) — attacker makes the server perform HTTP/network requests (often to internal services).
Mitigation: validate/whitelist URLs, block private IP ranges, network segmentation.

XML External Entity (XXE) / Unsafe XML parsing — XML parsers resolve external entities causing data exfiltration or SSRF.
Mitigation: disable external entity resolution, use safe parsers.

Insecure Deserialization — deserializing untrusted data leads to object injection or RCE.
Mitigation: avoid native deserialization of untrusted data, use signatures/whitelists.

Open Redirects — app redirects to attacker‑controlled sites (phishing facilitation).
Mitigation: disallow open redirects or validate/whitelist redirect targets.

Directory Traversal / Path Traversal — attacker reads files outside allowed dirs (e.g., ../../etc/passwd).
Mitigation: canonicalize and validate paths, run services with limited FS permissions.

Clickjacking — UI is framed to trick users into clicking hidden controls.
Mitigation: set X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors.

Man‑in‑the‑Middle (MITM) — interception of traffic between client and server.
Mitigation: use TLS everywhere, HSTS, certificate pinning where appropriate.

Supply‑Chain Attacks — compromise of third‑party libraries or CI/CD tooling.
Mitigation: vet dependencies, pin versions, use SBOMs and reproducible builds.

Brute Force / Credential Stuffing — automated guessing or replaying leaked credentials.
Mitigation: rate‑limit/login throttling, MFA, detect unusual patterns.

Denial of Service (DoS) / Resource Exhaustion — overwhelm service to make it unavailable.
Mitigation: rate limiting, autoscaling, WAF, upstream DDoS protection.

Business Logic Flaws — application flows abused in ways developers didn’t intend (e.g., duplicate refunds).
Mitigation: threat modeling, code reviews, enforce invariants server‑side.

HTTP Header Injection / Response Splitting — attacker injects CRLF to manipulate headers or cache.
Mitigation: validate header values, avoid reflecting raw user input in headers.

Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI) — include and execute files via unsafe includes.
Mitigation: disallow dynamic includes, whitelist file names, sanitize inputs.

Privacy / Sensitive Data Exposure — leaking PII, secrets, or keys in logs, responses, or repos.
Mitigation: encrypt sensitive data, avoid logging secrets, enforce access controls.

Short answer: no — that list covered the common web/app attacks, but it wasn’t exhaustive. There are many more specific, niche, platform‑level, and hybrid attacks — and new ones keep appearing. Below I’ll summarize additional important categories you may see and why they matter.

More attack types (brief)

Social engineering (phishing, vishing, smishing, pretexting) — trick people, not code.

Insider threats — malicious or careless employees leaking or abusing access.

Zero‑day / supply‑chain subtleties — previously unknown bugs or poisoned dependencies (e.g., dependency‑confusion, typosquatting packages).

Side‑channel & microarchitectural attacks — timing, cache (Spectre/Meltdown), Rowhammer, etc.

Cryptographic attacks — padding oracle, weak randomness, downgrade attacks, side‑channel against keys.

Network & infrastructure attacks — DNS hijack, BGP hijack, MITM variants, ARP spoofing.

Cloud‑specific risks — IAM misconfiguration, exposed S3/Blobs, overly permissive roles, metadata service abuse.

Container / orchestration threats — container escape, pod misconfig, exposed kube APIs, cluster privilege escalation.

Mobile app threats — intent spoofing, insecure storage, malicious third‑party SDKs, APK repackaging.

IoT / hardware attacks — insecure firmware, default creds, physical tampering.

API abuse / business logic abuse — scraping, rate‑limit bypasses, replay attacks, abuse of undocumented endpoints.

DNS / cache poisoning — redirecting traffic to attacker infrastructure.

Cryptojacking / covert resource abuse — using your CPU/GPU to mine or run workloads.

Physical attacks — stealing devices, tampering with hardware, social engineering on-site.

Blockchain / smart contract bugs — reentrancy, integer overflow, oracle manipulation.

Automated/AI‑driven attacks — credential stuffing at scale, synthetic‑voice vishing, targeted deepfake scams.
